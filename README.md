# MNIST dataset classification with a Deep Neural Network

## About the data

* The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
* The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
* Data taken from tensorflow.keras.datasets module.
